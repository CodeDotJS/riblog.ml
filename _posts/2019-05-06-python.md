Some good Python Books!

Right now, I'm just adding books. Maybe in future, I can add blogs and tutorials, but for now, this list is enough to learn and understand Python in a really nice way.

- __Stage 1__

	- Learn Python 3 : The Hard Way
	- Starting Out Python
	- Think Like A Computer Scientist

- __Stage 2__

	- Automate The Boring Stuff
	- Python for Informatics

- __Stage 3__

	- Learning Python by Mark Lutz
	- Fluent Python

- __Stage 4__

	- Python Pocket Reference
	- Python Tricks by Dan Bader

- __Stage 5__

	- Effective Python
	- Python Cookbook
	- Python 3 Standard Library by Example

To study Data Structure & Algorithms, we can either read __Grokking Algorithms__ *or* __Data Structures and Algorithms in Python By Goodrich, Tamassia, and Goldwasser.__

We can master running only if we learn to walk. With the help of these books, we learn to walk.
