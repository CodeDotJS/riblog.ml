__Books for Phase One Studies.__

I haven't prepared any time-table, and neither I know how much time it's going to take. And let's be honest - this is a big list of topics, so its definitely going to take some quality amount of time.

The only reason I'm not mentioning sites and tutorials in this post is because it's hard to select a few. Also, the study will require a lot of googling, so, cherry-picking sounds kinda irrelevant.

You don't know what you may find, and where you may find.
