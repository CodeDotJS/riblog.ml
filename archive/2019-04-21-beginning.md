I love Computers, and I love Computer Science, but I always feel like I've extremely less knowledge about it and it's various branches. On a lighter note, I'm not a beginner, and I'm not in the section of people who study Computer Science for the sake of a job, but the level of knowledge I hold is not enough for me. I want to study more. I desire to know deeper.

A few things that I enjoy other than writing code is understanding how things work under the hood, and I've created __`riblog`__ to put everything I'll learn and discover during my studies.

At current, I'm not sure what you'll get to read. It isn't an attempt or a place to teach others about anything. This place will be more like a arena of "Self Notes", where I'll write down things for the sake of understanding them better.

This blog will be all about __Mathematics__, __Programming Languages__ (C, C++, Python, and JavaScript), __Data Structure & Algorithms__, __Computer Architecture__, __Operating Systems__(Linux), __Computer Security__, __Compilers__, and __Networking__.

I hope this place grows content-wise, and I hope you and I get to learn something new!

__Cheers__
